üóÇÔ∏è Understanding the Code - File by File
Let's break down each file and explain what every part does in simple terms.

üìÑ app.py - Main Application File
Purpose: This is the heart of the application. It creates the web interface and coordinates all the features.

Key Sections:
1. Imports (Lines 1-17)

import streamlit as st
import cv2
import json
...
What it does: Loads all the tools (libraries) we need

streamlit - Creates the web pages
cv2 (OpenCV) - Handles cameras and face detection
json - Saves and loads data files
camera_manager, face_recognition_engine, notification_service - Our custom code files
2. Session State Initialization (Lines 20-33)

if 'camera_manager' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.camera_manager = CameraManager()
What it does: Creates "memory" for the app

Session state = data that persists while you use the app
Initializes managers only once (not every time the page refreshes)
Stores: cameras, face engine, notifications, monitoring status
3. Helper Functions

a. get_cached_camera_status() (Lines 35-54)

def get_cached_camera_status(camera_url: str) -> bool:
What it does: Checks if a camera is working (online/offline)

Caching: Saves the result for 30 seconds
Why? Checking cameras is slow, so we don't check every second
Returns True if camera works, False if it doesn't
b. should_send_notification() (Lines 56-68)

def should_send_notification(match_name: str, camera_name: str) -> bool:
What it does: Prevents notification spam

Debouncing: Only allows 1 notification per person per minute
Keeps track of last notification time
Returns True if enough time has passed, False if too soon
4. FaceRecognitionTransformer Class (Lines 71-165)

class FaceRecognitionTransformer:
    def __init__(self, face_engine, notification_service, camera_name):
What it does: Processes each video frame for face recognition

Key Methods:

a. __init__() - Setup

self.detection_interval = 3  # Run face detection every 3 seconds
self.latest_matches = []
self.frame_count = 0
Sets up variables
detection_interval = 3 means detect faces every 3 seconds (not every frame)
Tracks latest matches and frame count
b. transform() - Process Each Frame

def transform(self, frame):
    img = frame.to_ndarray(format="bgr24")
Receives each video frame
Converts frame to a format OpenCV can use (numpy array)
Runs face detection every 3 seconds
Draws boxes and text on faces
Sends notifications if someone is recognized
How face detection works in this function:

Check if 3 seconds have passed since last detection
If yes: run face_engine.detect_faces_in_frame()
Save the results in self.latest_matches
Send notifications for any recognized faces
Draw boxes and text on ALL frames (using the latest results)
Drawing on frames:

cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), color, 4)
cv2.putText(img, name_label, ...)
cv2.rectangle() draws the colored box
cv2.putText() writes the name and percentage
Color is green (0, 255, 0) for matches, red (0, 0, 255) for unknown
5. Page Functions

üìÑ camera_manager.py - Camera Management
Purpose: Handles all camera-related operations (add, remove, connect, capture).

Class: CameraManager
1. Initialization (Lines 10-13)

def __init__(self):
    self.cameras_file = "data/cameras.json"
    self.ensure_data_directory()
    self.cameras = self.load_cameras()
What it does:

Sets file path for saving camera data
Creates data folder if it doesn't exist

2. Data Management Methods

a. load_cameras() (Lines 19-27)

def load_cameras(self) -> List[Dict]:
What it does:

Reads cameras.json file
Returns a list of camera dictionaries
Each camera = {"name": "...", "url": "...", "status": "..."}
Returns empty list [] if file doesn't exist
b. save_cameras() (Lines 29-32)

def save_cameras(self):
What it does:

Writes the camera list to cameras.json
Uses indent=2 to make the JSON file human-readable
3. Camera Operations

a. add_camera() (Lines 34-56)

def add_camera(self, name: str, url: str) -> bool:
What it does:

Checks for duplicates: Ensures camera name/URL isn't already added
Validates connection:
If URL is a number (e.g., "0") = local webcam, skip test
If URL is an address = test the connection first
Creates camera data: Name, URL, date added, status
Saves to file
Returns: True if successful, False if failed
b. remove_camera() (Lines 58-64)

def remove_camera(self, index: int) -> bool:
What it does:

Saves updated list to file
Returns True if successful
c. get_cameras() (Lines 66-68)

def get_cameras(self) -> List[Dict]:
What it does:

Simply returns the list of all cameras
Used by other parts of the app to display cameras
4. Camera Connection Methods

a. check_camera_status() (Lines 70-94)

def check_camera_status(self, url: str) -> bool:
What it does: Tests if a camera is working

Process:

For local webcam (e.g., "0"):

Converts string to integer
Opens camera with cv2.VideoCapture(0)
Tries to read one frame
Returns True if frame is captured successfully
For IP camera (e.g., "http://..."):

Opens camera with cv2.VideoCapture(url)
Tries to read one frame
If that fails, tries HTTP request as backup
Returns True if camera responds
b. capture_frame() (Lines 96-115)

def capture_frame(self, url: str) -> Optional[np.ndarray]:
What it does: Captures a single snapshot from camera

Process:

Opens camera connection
Reads one frame
Closes connection (important! releases camera)
Returns the frame as a numpy array (image data)
Returns None if capture failed
Why release the camera?

Cameras can only be accessed by one program at a time
Releasing allows other programs (or this app again) to use it
5. Helper Method

a. get_camera_by_name() (Lines 117-122)

def get_camera_by_name(self, name: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
What it does:

Searches for a camera by its name
Returns the camera dictionary if found
Returns None if not found
üìÑ face_recognition_engine.py - Face Detection & Recognition
Purpose: Handles all face detection and recognition logic using OpenCV.

Class: FaceRecognitionEngine
1. Initialization (Lines 11-55)

def __init__(self):
    # Initialize OpenCV face detector
    cascade_filename = 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml'
What it does:

Loads the Haar Cascade face detector (a pre-trained model)
Sets up file paths for storing reference faces and detections
Creates necessary directories
What is Haar Cascade?

It's a machine learning algorithm that can detect faces
Trained on thousands of face images
Looks for patterns like eyes, nose, mouth
Comes free with OpenCV
Why multiple path checks?

Different systems store OpenCV files in different locations
The code tries several common paths to find the cascade file
Falls back to cv2.data.haarcascades if all else fails
2. Reference Face Management

a. add_reference_face() (Lines 117-194)

def add_reference_face(self, image: Image.Image, name: str) -> bool:
What it does: Saves a photo as a reference for recognition

Step-by-step process:

Step 1: Convert image format

image_np = np.array(image)
if image_np.shape[2] == 4:  # RGBA
    image_cv = cv2.cvtColor(image_np, cv2.COLOR_RGBA2BGR)
PIL (Pillow) images are in RGB format
OpenCV uses BGR format (colors reversed)
Converts RGBA (with transparency) or RGB to BGR
Handles grayscale images too
Step 2: Prepare for detection

gray = cv2.cvtColor(image_cv, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
gray = cv2.equalizeHist(gray)
Converts to grayscale (face detection works better on grayscale)
equalizeHist() improves contrast (makes faces easier to detect)
Step 3: Detect faces

faces = self.face_cascade.detectMultiScale(
    gray, 
    scaleFactor=1.1,
    minNeighbors=3,
    minSize=(30, 30)
)
detectMultiScale() finds all faces in the image
scaleFactor=1.1: How much to shrink image at each scale (smaller = slower but more accurate)
minNeighbors=3: How many detections needed to confirm a face (lower = more sensitive)
minSize=(30, 30): Minimum face size in pixels
If no faces found, try again with relaxed settings:

if len(faces) == 0:
    faces = self.face_cascade.detectMultiScale(
        gray, 
        scaleFactor=1.05,  # More sensitive
        minNeighbors=2
    )
Step 4: Extract and save the face

x, y, w, h = faces[0]  # Use first detected face
face_crop = image_cv[y:y+h, x:x+w]  # Crop to just the face
cv2.imwrite(face_path, face_crop)  # Save cropped face
Gets coordinates of the face box (x, y, width, height)
Crops the image to just the face area
Saves both the full image and cropped face
Step 5: Save metadata

self.reference_faces[name] = {
    'image_path': image_path,
    'face_path': face_path,
    'face_coordinates': (int(x), int(y), int(w), int(h)),
    'added_date': datetime.datetime.now().isoformat()
}
Stores file paths
Saves face coordinates (converted to Python int from numpy int32)
Records when the face was added
Saves to JSON file
b. remove_reference_face() (Lines 196-214)

def remove_reference_face(self, name: str) -> bool:
What it does:

Deletes both image files (full image and cropped face)
Removes entry from reference faces dictionary
Saves updated data to JSON
3. Face Detection in Live Video

a. detect_faces_in_frame() (Lines 234-308)

def detect_faces_in_frame(self, frame: np.ndarray, camera_name: str) -> List[Dict]:
What it does: Finds and recognizes faces in a video frame

Step-by-step process:

Step 1: Prepare frame

gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
gray = cv2.equalizeHist(gray)
Same as before: convert to grayscale and enhance contrast
Step 2: Detect faces

faces = self.face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, ...)
Finds all faces in the frame
Returns list of face coordinates
Step 3: For each detected face, compare to references

for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
    face_crop = gray[y:y+h, x:x+w]
    best_match = self.compare_face(face_crop)
Crops each detected face
Compares it to all saved reference faces
Finds the best match (if any)
Step 4: Build results

matches.append({
    'name': best_match['name'],
    'percentage': best_match['confidence'] * 100,
    'face_coordinates': (x, y, w, h),
    'camera': camera_name,
    'timestamp': datetime.datetime.now().isoformat()
})
Creates a dictionary for each detected face
Includes name, confidence percentage, location
Adds timestamp and camera name
Step 5: Log detection

If someone is recognized, adds to detection history
Saves to detections.json
Keeps record of all detections
4. Face Comparison Method

a. compare_face() (Lines 310-346)

def compare_face(self, face_image: np.ndarray) -> Dict:
What it does: Compares one face to all reference faces

Template Matching Process:

Step 1: Resize detected face to standard size

target_size = (100, 100)
face_resized = cv2.resize(face_image, target_size)
Makes all faces the same size for fair comparison
100x100 pixels is a good balance
Step 2: Compare to each reference face

for name, ref_data in self.reference_faces.items():
    ref_image = cv2.imread(ref_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    ref_resized = cv2.resize(ref_image, target_size)
    
    result = cv2.matchTemplate(face_resized, ref_resized, cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED)
    similarity = result[0][0]
What is matchTemplate()?

Compares two images pixel by pixel
Returns a similarity score from -1 to 1
cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED = normalized correlation method
Higher score = more similar
Step 3: Find best match

if similarity > best_match['confidence']:
    best_match = {
        'name': name,
        'confidence': similarity
    }
Keeps track of the highest similarity score
Updates best_match if a better match is found
Step 4: Check threshold

if best_match['confidence'] < self.settings['confidence_threshold']:
    return {'name': 'No Match', 'confidence': 0}
If best match is below threshold (default 60%), return "No Match"
Threshold prevents false positives
5. Settings Management

a. load_settings() and update_settings()

Loads/saves face recognition settings
Default threshold: 0.6 (60%)
Stored in data/face_settings.json
üìÑ notification_service.py - Email Alerts
Purpose: Sends email notifications when faces are recognized.

Class: NotificationService
1. Initialization (Lines 10-32)

def __init__(self):
    self.settings_file = "data/notification_settings.json"
    self.settings = self.load_settings()
Default settings:

default_settings = {
    'email_enabled': False,
    'recipient_email': '',
    'smtp_server': 'smtp.gmail.com',
    'smtp_port': 587,
    'sender_email': '',
    'sender_password': ''
}
What each setting means:

email_enabled: Turn notifications on/off
recipient_email: Who receives the alerts
smtp_server: Email server address (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
smtp_port: Connection port (587 for TLS)
sender_email: Your email address (that sends alerts)
sender_password: Your email password or app password
2. Sending Notifications

a. send_notification() (Lines 41-45)

def send_notification(self, message: str, subject: Optional[str] = None) -> bool:
What it does:

Checks if email is enabled
If yes, calls send_email_notification()
Returns True if sent successfully
b. send_email_notification() (Lines 47-91)

def send_email_notification(self, message: str, subject: Optional[str] = None) -> bool:
What it does: Sends an actual email

Step-by-step process:

Step 1: Validate settings

if not all([
    self.settings['recipient_email'],
    self.settings['sender_email'],
    self.settings['sender_password']
]):
    return False
Checks that all required fields are filled in
Returns False if anything is missing
Step 2: Create email message

msg = MIMEMultipart()
msg['From'] = self.settings['sender_email']
msg['To'] = self.settings['recipient_email']
msg['Subject'] = subject or "Camera Alert"
MIMEMultipart() creates an email object
Sets sender, recipient, and subject
Step 3: Add email body

body = f"""
Camera Monitoring Alert
{message}
Time: {datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}
"""
msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))
Formats the message with timestamp
Attaches as plain text
Step 4: Connect to email server

server = smtplib.SMTP(self.settings['smtp_server'], self.settings['smtp_port'])
server.starttls()  # Enable encryption
server.login(self.settings['sender_email'], self.settings['sender_password'])
SMTP() connects to email server
starttls() encrypts the connection (secure)
login() authenticates with your credentials
Step 5: Send email

server.sendmail(sender, recipient, msg.as_string())
server.quit()  # Close connection
Sends the email
Closes the connection properly
What is SMTP?

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
The standard way to send emails on the internet
Like the postal service for email
Why TLS (port 587)?

Transport Layer Security
Encrypts your email and password
Prevents hackers from intercepting your credentials
3. Testing

a. test_email_settings() (Lines 93-95)

def test_email_settings(self) -> bool:
    return self.send_email_notification("This is a test message", "Test Notification")
What it does:

üîß Troubleshooting
Camera Issues
Problem: Camera won't connect Solutions:

Make sure no other program is using the webcam (close Zoom, Skype, etc.)
Try index 1 or 2 instead of 0 for webcam
On Windows, try python -m streamlit run app.py instead of just streamlit run app.py
Check if your webcam has a physical privacy cover closed
Problem: "Connection is taking longer than expected" on Replit Solution: This is a Replit cloud limitation. Run the app locally on your computer for webcam access.

Face Detection Issues
Problem: Face not detected in uploaded photo Solutions:

Use a well-lit, clear photo
Face should be front-facing, not profile
Try a closer photo (face fills more of the frame)
Remove sunglasses/hats
Make sure image isn't too dark or too bright
Problem: Face recognition not accurate Solutions:

Increase confidence threshold in Settings (e.g., 70%)
Add more reference photos of the same person
Use clearer reference photos
Make sure lighting is similar between reference photo and live feed
Email Notification Issues
Problem: Email won't send Solutions:

For Gmail: Use an App Password, not your regular password
Go to: Google Account ‚Üí Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification ‚Üí App Passwords
Check that all email fields are filled in
Verify SMTP server and port are correct
Test your email login in a regular email client first
Installation Issues
Problem: pip install fails Solutions:

Make sure Python is added to PATH
Try: python -m pip install <package>
Update pip: python -m pip install --upgrade pip
On Windows, run Command Prompt as Administrator
Problem: Import errors when running Solution: Reinstall all packages:

pip uninstall streamlit streamlit-webrtc opencv-python
pip install streamlit streamlit-webrtc opencv-python pillow numpy aiortc av requests
